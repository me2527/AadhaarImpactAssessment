# AadhaarImpactAssessment
In this project, you need to analyse the In-depth datasets provided by the State of Aadhaar. The State of Aadhaar 2019 was an initiative taken to give a broad discourse on the use of Aadhaar and to help in identifying which aspects of Aadhaar are working and not working, to what extent and for whom.  You need to analyse these in-depth datasets to answer the following questions:      How many Aadhaar centres are there in urban and rural India, does it affect the accessibility of Aadhaar enrolment?      How Aadhaar has changed the implementation of government schemes like bank account monitoring and telecom services?      What are the sentiments of people about Aadhaar?
